# AlexNet Implementation with TensorFlow and Keras

## Introduction
This repository presents an implementation of the AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Learning Objectives
By exploring this repository, you will gain insights into the following key areas:
- Introduction to neural network implementation with Keras and TensorFlow.
- Data preprocessing techniques using TensorFlow.
- Visualization of training progress with TensorBoard.
- Explanation of standard machine learning terms and terminologies.

## AlexNet Implementation
AlexNet CNN serves as an excellent starting point for understanding deep learning principles. While it may not be as complex as some of the more recent CNN architectures, AlexNet offers a solid foundation for beginners and intermediate practitioners to grasp essential model implementation techniques.

### Why AlexNet?
- **Simplicity**: AlexNet is relatively straightforward compared to more recent CNN architectures, making it accessible for learners.
- **Demonstration**: Implementing AlexNet allows practitioners to understand fundamental concepts and techniques in deep learning effectively.

### TensorFlow and Keras
**TensorFlow** and **Keras** are widely used open-source libraries for developing deep learning models. Here's a brief overview of each:

- **TensorFlow**: Developed by Google Brain, TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It provides comprehensive tools and libraries for building and deploying machine learning models across a range of platforms.

- **Keras**: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and easy prototyping of deep learning models.

In this project, we leverage the power of TensorFlow as the backend for Keras, enabling seamless integration and efficient execution of our AlexNet implementation.
